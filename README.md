**Make inpatient coding and claims adjudication transparent, accurate, and auditable—so providers get paid fairly and payers see exactly why each dollar posts.**

> **Development Status**: This is an MVP implementation showcasing the core architecture and functionality. The system includes working API endpoints, sample terminology data, and basic ML-assisted coding recommendations. Ready for development, testing, and contributions!

## Mission

FairClaimRCM is an open-source healthcare revenue cycle management system that brings transparency and accuracy to medical coding and claims processing. Our goal is to eliminate the black box nature of current RCM systems and provide clear, auditable explanations for every coding decision and reimbursement calculation.

## Key Features

- **Transparent Coding**: AI-assisted medical coding with complete audit trails
- **Explainable AI**: Every coding decision comes with human-readable explanations
- **Audit-Ready**: Full compliance tracking and documentation
- **Extensible**: Modular architecture for easy customization
- **Standards-Compliant**: Built on HL7/FHIR, ICD-10, CPT standards
- **Fast API**: RESTful endpoints for seamless integration

## Architecture

### Core Modules

| Module | Responsibility |
|--------|----------------|
| **Terminology & Mapping** | ICD-10, CPT, DRG lookup service with version tracking |
| **Code Recommendation** | Rule-based + ML-assisted code suggestion with confidence scoring |
| **Audit & Explainability** | Per-claim "why this code" reports with decision traces |
| **Reimbursement Engine** | Fee schedule processing and reimbursement simulation |
| **Claims Validation API** | REST endpoints for chart submission and claim processing |
| **Web UI Dashboard** | Interactive interface for claim analysis and metrics |
| **Data Connectors** | HL7/FHIR ingestion and legacy system exports |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+ (for web UI - optional)
- PostgreSQL (or SQLite for development)
- Docker (optional)

### Option 1: Quick Start Script

```bash
# Make the script executable and run it
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

This script will:
- Create a virtual environment
- Install dependencies
- Run basic tests
- Start the API server

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env as needed
   ```

3. **Start the API server**
   ```bash
   cd api
   python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

4. **Access the API documentation**
   Open http://localhost:8000/docs in your browser

### Option 3: Docker Quick Start

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Testing the Installation

```bash
# Test core functionality
python3 tests/test_core.py

# Use the CLI tool
python3 cli.py health
python3 cli.py analyze "Patient presents with chest pain"

# Run API examples
cd examples && python3 basic_api_usage.py
```
